== Create a simple Camel K route and start it running

=== Step 1: Create a Simple Java Integration

First, we need to create a simple Java Camel K example. You can do this using the `Create a new Apache Camel K Integration file` command. (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.integrations.createNewIntegrationFile&text=Java$$HelloWorld[Execute^])

Inside VS Code, press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` to bring up the Command Palette, and type `Create a new Apache Camel K Integration file`. When the command is selected, click Enter.

1. Choose the language to use (choose `Java`).
2. Choose the workspace folder (press Enter to select the current workspace root folder)
3. Provide a name for the new file (be sure not to include the file extension or it will be repeated) (type `HelloWorld`)

When you complete step 3, you should see the file `HelloWorld.java` appear in your workspace folder.

=== Step 2: Exploring the Java Integration file

Now that you have an integration file, let's take a quick look at it. Go ahead and open it now. Go to the Explorer activity (Ctrl+Shift+E) and find it in the tree view.

* Note: If you have the `HelloWorld.java` file in the root folder of your workspace, you can open the HelloWorld.java file in the editor with link:didact://?commandId=vscode.openFolder&projectFilePath=HelloWorld.java[this link].

Your file should look like this:

....
// camel-k: language=java

import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class HelloWorld extends RouteBuilder {
  @Override
  public void configure() throws Exception {

      // Write your routes here, for example:
      from("timer:java?period=1s")
        .routeId("java")
        .setBody()
          .simple("Hello Camel K from ${routeId}")
        .to("log:info");

  }
}
....

For this file, we're simply telling Camel to put the message `Hello Camel K from ${routeId}` in the console once every second.

=== Step 3: Deploying the Integration

The `Tooling for Camel K` extension offers several tools to get your new integration started. 

First, you can right-click your integration file and select `Start Apache Camel K Integration`. That will provide a drop-down in the Command palette area with a number of deployment options. In this case, select the `Dev Mode - Apache Camel K Integration in Dev Mode` option. 

* (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.startintegration[Execute^])

Since this is likely the first time you've started a new integration in Camel K, it might take a bit to spin up the necessary resources on the target system. While that starts up, we can look at the `Apache Camel K` Output channel and watch as the Camel K operator starts up the necessary resources to run our integration.

When your route finishes deploying, you will begin to see messages showing up in the log window.

== Step 4: Updating the Integration

While our integration is running in `Dev Mode`, we can modify it and see those changes reflected in the deployed integration. Let's try that now.

Change the message sent to the `.simple()` command of the Camel route in quotes to `We just changed our first Camel K integration while it was running!`. 

Save the file and see what happens in the Apache Camel K Output channel.

== Step 5: Managing our Integration

We can see what integrations we currently have running in our Minikube system in the `Apache Camel K Integrations` view in the Explorer activity (Ctrl+Shift+E).

* Open the `Apache Camel K Integrations` view (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.integrations.focus[Execute^])

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camel-tooling/vscode-camelk/master/images/camelk-integrations-view-remove-menu.jpg[Integrations view with context menu,role="right"]

From here, we can:

* Hover over the `Apache Camel K Integrations` view and click the `Open Apache Camel K Operator Log` button to view it. (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.integrations.openOperatorLog[Execute^])
* Hover over the integration name to see its current state in the tooltip. (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.integrations.selectFirstNode[Execute to select first integration in tree^])
* Right-click on the running integration to `Remove Apache Camel K Integration` and undeploy it. (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.integrations.remove[DANGER! WILL REMOVE RUNNING INTEGRATION])
* Right-click on the running integration to `Follow kit builder log for running Apache Camel K Integration` (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.integrations.kitlog[Execute to view log for first integration in tree^])

While we are running in `Dev Mode`, all our logged output goes to the main `Apache Camel K` Output channel, but if the integration is running in another mode (such as `Basic`), we can explicitly open a new log window to see events for that running integration.

* To open a separate log window for your route, right-click on the deployed integration 'hello-world' in the `Apache Camel K Integrations` view and select `Follow log for running Apache Camel K Integration`. (link:didact://?commandId=camelk.integrations.log[Execute to view log for first integration in tree^])

== Did it work? 

You should see your Camel route injecting a new message in the log every few seconds.

== Did it not work?

Remove the integration and try the steps again. If it's still not working:

. Validate that you have access to the Apache Camel K CLI (via terminal or via command)
. Check if something went wrong when starting the integration. View the Apache Camel K Operator log from the view toolbar or Kit Builder log available when you right-click the integration
